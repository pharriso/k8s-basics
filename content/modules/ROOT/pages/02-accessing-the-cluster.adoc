For the exercises you will be doing, you will be using the `kubectl` command line program to interact with Kubernetes. 

The terminal window is provided for you via the interactive terminal session available in your workshop guide.  

The workshop environment also provides you with a web based view into the Kubernetes cluster. This web based view uses the web interface which is included in OpenShift 4. Whilst not part of the workshop, it is included here so you can visually see the results of what you do in the exercises if you want, the exercises do not depend on it. The web interface provided here is different to the web interface that may be provided with other Kubernetes distributions.

Testing cluster details 

To access the OpenShift Console, navigate to the following URL in your browser and log in using the provided credentials:

*Console URL:* link:{ocp4_starter_console_url}[{ocp4_starter_console_url},window='_blank']

*Username:* `{user}`

*Password:* `{ocp4_starter_password}`


## Accessing the terminal window so you can use the cluster

### Workshop Environment

You workshop environment looks like:

image::workshop-screenshot.png[Workshop Guide, 1000]

### Login

On the right hand side of the screen, as above, you'll see 2 terminal windows that you can use to complete the labs.

In one of the terminals windows you need to login to the cluster, logging into one of them will also provide the login context to the other. Feel free to use one of both of the windows. One of the labs later on will take advantage of having 2 terminal windows.

Enter the following command:

`oc login  https://api.cluster-{guid}.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io:6443 -u {user} -p {password} -insecure-skip-tls-verify`

You should see the following in response to the command:

```
WARNING: Using insecure TLS client config. Setting this option is not supported!

Login successful.

You have one project on this server: "wksp-{user}"

Using project "wksp-user1".
```

As an enterprise Kubernetes platform, the environment you are using is locked down and you are unable to create namespaces. Namespaces enable you to isolate your resources within a single cluster. The isolation is what's enabling all workshop attendees to perform the same labs on the same cluster without impacting each other's work.

A namespace has automatically been created for you, it is called 

wksp-{user}

You won't really know that you are using it, as your environment will default to it all the time. It's good to know that it is being used though, as namespaces will become an important facility you use to isolate workloads on the clusters. 


NOTE: The workshop will now take place in the terminal window. 

### Clone the GIT repository required for the workshop

The workshop materials are held in a publically available Github repository, you need to clone it. To do this, in the terminal window enter the following:

[.console-input]
[source, execute]
----
git clone https://github.com/pprosser-redhat/k8s-basics.git
----

You can see the resulting clone in both terminal windows.

To be prepared to use the repositories workshop files, change directory to it:

[.console-input]
[source, execute]
----
cd k8s-basics-dev/apps
----

All of the files we need will be accessible from the directory you are now in.

NOTE: After a certain amount of inactivity, the terminal will shutdown. That's fine as there is a button you press to restart the session if needed. However, the terminal is stateless, therefore you will need to perform the git clone again. 


### Test kubectl
Before continuing, verify that the `kubectl` command runs and the workshop environment is also functioning. To do this run:

[.console-input]
[source, execute]
----
kubectl version
----

Did you type the command in yourself? If you did, you can make things easier by copy and pasting the command into the interactive terminal.

When run, you should see output similar to:

[.console-output]
[source]
----
Client Version: v1.31.1
Kustomize Version: v5.4.2
Server Version: v1.31.10
----
