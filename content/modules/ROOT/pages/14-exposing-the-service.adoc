In order to expose a `service` so that it is accessible outside of the Kubernetes cluster, you need to create an `ingress` resource object.

To see the definition for the `ingress` resource object we will use run:

[.console-input]
[source,execute]
----
cat frontend-v2/ingress-parksmap.yaml
----

You should see output:

[.console-output]
[source]
----
kind: Ingress
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: parksmap
  labels:
    app: workshop
    role: frontend
spec:
  rules:
    - host: parksmap-wksp-{user}.apps.cluster-{guid}.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: parksmap
                port:
                  number: 8080
----

The `rules` section in the `ingress` definition is what controls what should happen when traffic for your web application is received by the router for the Kubernetes cluster.

In this case the rule says that any HTTP requests received for the host `parksmap-wksp-{user}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}` should be directed to the application with `service` object named `parksmap`.

When an external user accesses the host name from their web browser, they will use the standard port 80 for HTTP traffic, the router will pass through that traffic to port 8080 of the `service`.

As in the first module, you need to adjust the host in the `ingress-parksmap.yaml` file to match your environment.

In the terminal window, edit the file `frontend-v2/ingress-parksmap.yaml`

type
[.console-output]
[source, execute]
----
vim frontend-v2/ingress-parksmap.yaml
----

and change the `host` field from what you see in the screenshot below:

image::ingress-screenshot.png[Parksmap Ingress, 900]

to the host field you see below.

`- host: parksmap-wksp-{user}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}`

To update the configuration for the front end web application to add the `ingress` run:

[.console-output]
[source, execute]
----
kubectl apply -f frontend-v2/
----

This should output:

```
deployment.apps/blog configured
ingress.extensions/blog created
service/blog unchanged
```

You can review the `ingress` resource which was created by running:

[.console-output]
[source, execute]
----
kubectl get ingress -l component=parksmap
----

Now that the `ingress` has been created, you can access the front end web application using a web browser at:

http://parksmap-wksp-{user}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}

Note that this works because a wildcard CNAME has already been pre-configured in an external domain name server (DNS) to direct traffic for this host to the router for the Kubernetes cluster. If this was your own Kubernetes cluster, you would need to configure an appropriate CNAME in the DNS for the host you want to use.
